# Stefania Frustagli, Freelance Journalist Portfolio

This is a portfolio website for my work as a freelance journalist.

The website features a homepage with selected writings, an about page and a contact page. The website is primarily intended to attract potential editors who may be interested in collaborating with me and commission pieces of work.

## User Experience

### Strategy & Scope

My intention was to design a simple and minimalistic website, with essential information easily accessible.

The primary goal was to provide a showcase of my work to editors. Considering their busy schedules, I wanted my work to be immediately accessible, so I made the 'Selected writings' section the site homepage. Also, to attract visitors' attention, I wanted the hero image to be the largest part of the page. I added a few lines from my articles as a teaser, and used a bright colour palette (most notably, a vibrant emerald green) to make the page visually appealing.

### Website's goals

- Provide selected examples of my articles and writing styles;
- Outline my intentions as journalist;
- Mention my experience and qualifications;
- Provide email address and social network accounts for easy contact.

### I can achieve my goal most effectively through this website because

- It groups and shows my work in one page;

- It's essential and easy to navigate;

- It lists my contact information and social media accounts;
  
- It features a distinctive llustration to attract viewers' attention.

### Ideal viewers

- The main target audience is editors to whom I send article ideas and seek collaboration;
- Journalists or general readers who wish to acknowledge my work or are interested in the topics I cover;
- English speaking, since all articles selected are in English.
  
### User stories

- As a publication commissioning editor, I expect to gain an overview of Stefania's writing style and the publications she has contributed to. She has pitched me an article idea, and I have to decide whether to accept it and commission a piece.
- As a freelance journalist myself, I'm interested in reading more about some of the other journalists' activities.
- As a reader, I'm interested in Stefania's articles and keen to learn more about her writing activity.

## Design

### Wireframes
Below are the wireframes I created during the design process (whose aspect and colour slightly differ from the final product):

### Palette
The colour palette was generated from the hero image using [Color Palette Extractor](https://mdigi.tools/color-extractor/).

![Colour palette](https://i.ibb.co/GnDPVh0/Colour-palette.png "Colour palette")

### Hero image
The hero image is an illustration I personally commissioned to artist Valeria Weerasinge.

![Illustration by author Valeria Weerasinghe showing a girl peacefully working on her laptop surrounded by newspapers, a coffee machine and an espresso cup](https://i.ibb.co/DDjPnMs/hero-image.webp "Illustration by Valeria Weerasinghe")

It is a cartoon illustration of me with elements that describe what I normally do: I am at my laptop, working, with my airPods on (probably listening to a podcast or some chill music). I am surrounded by a coffee machine, a small espresso cup (which reflects my Italian identity) and newspapers.

The main purpose of this image is to grab attention with its size, colour, and distinctiveness. I wanted it to be appealing and unique since it is the first thing the user sees when arriving at the website.

### Typography

The entire website uses the "Raleway" font, with Sans Serif serving as the fallback font in case the font isn't imported properly.

The font was imported into style.css using Google fonts.

### Favicon
The favicon was created using [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/).

I chose a simple round green button with a white lowercase 's', my first name's initial. Despite considering both my initials, I chose my first initial because of its shape. 
Below is the favicon as it appears in the tab:

## Features

### Existing Features
On each page, there is a header with a responsive **navigation bar** that includes my name as the logo (top left) that links to the homepage, and links to the 'About' and 'Contact' pages (top right).

A link to 'Selected writings' was also intended, but it was removed after my mentor's suggestion, mainly for aesthetic and functional reasons. It might be re-added in the future if I feel it makes the navigation bar more intuitive. As for now, I think viewers - editors in particular - will find their way around the website easily as the navbar is intuitive and simple to use.

![Header and navbar](https://i.ibb.co/crHK2fX/Screenshot-2023-08-28-at-16-38-32.png "Header and navbar")

All pages have a **footer** that links to my social media accounts (Instagram, Twitter/X and LinkedIn). Intuitive and immediate, it is ideal for editors and readers to quickly find me.

#### Homepage

On the homepage, the **Hero image** serves the purpose of making the site distinctive and grabbing the attention of visitors.

My articles are listed in the **Selected writings** section on the homepage. They are listed in chronological order (the most recent at the top) and a small preview is displayed to catch the eye. At the end of the preview, there is a clickable ">>" in green that changes color if hovered over. Each link opens in a new tab.

#### About page
The 'About' page provides a glimpse into my study path and experience. By reading this short bio, editors and viewers will get a sense of my personality and intentions as a journalist. I have also added a picture of myself to create a more "real" and approachable feel, as well as show my friendliness.

#### Contact page
The 'Contact' page contains an invitation to contact me either by email address or by filling out the form.

### Features and general aspects left to implement
Due to the short deadline and my limited knowledge, my focus was creating a functional and essential website. However, I hope to accomplish the following as I move forward:

- Add a page or section with my Italian writings and blog;
- Implement the 'About' page: 
  - add interactive information to make my personality more appealing to viewers. E.g. what I am reading at the moment, boardgames I've been playing, podcasts I am listening to, etc.
