# Stefania Frustagli, freelance journalist portfolio

This is my portfolio website for my work as a freelance journalist.

The website features a homepage with selected writings, an about page and a contact page. The website is primarily intended to attract potential editors who may be interested in collaborating with me.

The website's goals are:

* Provide selected examples of my articles and writing styles and;
* Outline my intentions and journalism style; 
* Mention my experience and qualifications;
* Provide email addresses and social network accounts for easy contact.

## UX

### Ideal viewers

* The main target audience is editors to whom I send article ideas and seek collaboration;
* Journalists or general readers who wish to acknowledge my work or are interested in the topics I cover;
* English speaking, since all articles selected are in English.

### User stories

* As a publication commissioning editor, I expect to gain an overview of Stefania's writing style and the publications she has contributed to. She has pitched me an article idea, and I have to decide whether to accept it and commission a piece.
* As a freelance journalist myself, I'm interested in reading more about some of the other journalists' activities
* As a reader, I'm interested in Stefania's articles and keen to learn more about her writing activity.
