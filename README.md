# Stefania Frustagli, freelance journalist portfolio

This is a portfolio website for my work as a freelance journalist.

The website features a homepage with selected writings, an about page and a contact page. The website is primarily intended to attract potential editors who may be interested in collaborating with me and commission pieces of work.

The website's goals are:

- Provide selected examples of my articles and writing styles;
- Outline my intentions as journalist;
- Mention my experience and qualifications;
- Provide email addresses and social network accounts for easy contact.

## UX

### Ideal viewers

- The main target audience is editors to whom I send article ideas and seek collaboration;
- Journalists or general readers who wish to acknowledge my work or are interested in the topics I cover;
- English speaking, since all articles selected are in English.

### User stories

- As a publication commissioning editor, I expect to gain an overview of Stefania's writing style and the publications she has contributed to. She has pitched me an article idea, and I have to decide whether to accept it and commission a piece.
- As a freelance journalist myself, I'm interested in reading more about some of the other journalists' activities.
- As a reader, I'm interested in Stefania's articles and keen to learn more about her writing activity.

## Strategy & Scope

My intention was to design a simple and minimalistic website, with essential information easily accessible.

The primary goal was to provide a showcase of my work to editor. Considering their busy schedules, I made the 'Selected writings' section the site homepage. Also, to attract visitors' attention, I wanted the hero image to be the largest part of the page. I added a few lines from my articles as a teaser, and used a bright colour palette to make the page visually appealing.

### I can achieve my goal most effectively through this website because:

* It groups and shows my work in one page;

* It's essential and easy to navigate;

* It lists my contact information;
  
* It features a distinctive llustration to attract viewers' attention.

## Graphic Design

### Palette

![Colour palette](https://i.ibb.co/GnDPVh0/Colour-palette.png "Colour palette")

The colour palette was generated from the hero image using [Color Palette Extractor](https://mdigi.tools/color-extractor/).

### Hero image
The hero image is an illustration I personally commissioned from artist Valeria Weerasinge.

It is a cartoon illustration of me with elements that describe what I normally do: I am at my laptop, working, with my airPods on (probably listening to a podcast or some chill music). I am surrounded by a coffee machine, a small espresso cup (which reflects my Italian identity) and newspapers.

### Favicon
The favicon was created using [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/)

I chose a simple round green button with a white lowercase 's', my first name's initial. Despite considering both my initials, I chose my first initial because of its size and shape. 
Below is the favicon as it appears in the tab:
